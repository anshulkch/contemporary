                                    In Rwanda and Burundi, the colonial powers favored the Tutsi people gave them positions of power over Hutu. Violence erupted in 1959 between the two groups and continued for decades. Its culmination occurred in 1994 in the Rwanda genocide in which hundreds of thousands of Tutsi were killed by Hutu. The civil war caused the economy to decline and labor to be lost. The structure of population was changed by the holocaust. This event was major to the development of Africa as a whole, and the immersive exhibit helps emulate the conditions the natives were forced to go through.

                                    Although many African colonies tried to resist colonial rule, most groups were unsuccessful until the mid-1900s. Under increasing pressure, Europeans power granted colonies independence throughout the mid-to-late 1900s. When countries gained independence, they often experience internal strife and conflict. This exhibit is a documentary film outlining the aspects of each freedom-fighting movement.

Amin seized power in a military coup in 1971 and ruled over Uganda for 8 years. Estimates for the number of his opponents who were either killed, tortured, or imprisoned vary from 100,000 to half a million. He was ousted in 1979 by Ugandan nationalists, after which he fled into exile.

                                    After South Africa became independent of Britain, the white minority in the country, known as Afrikaners, ran the government. It imposed a policy known as apartheid, or separation of the races and racial prejudice against non-white Africans. South Africans were denied political rights and equality with whites in many aspects of life, much like the United States before the Civil Rights movement. Internal unrest and international pressures forced South Africa to end apartheid. This exhibit is an interview of anti-Apartheid leader Nelson Mandela.
