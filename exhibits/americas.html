                                    This poster was an example of propaganda during World War II. Without it, hopes would have been at an all time low and not many Americans would have found the determination to fight, resulting in losing the war. During World War II, not many people were willing to join the fight after seeing the casualties of World War I and generally feared for their lives. However, through the employment of methods such as propaganda and bandwagoning, the government was able to coerce men to join the battle, leading to the eventuality of a victorious campaign.

                                    As World War II progressed, the demand for more vehicles and ammunition increased more and more, resulting in the forced innovation of the industrial industry. This also paved the way for women's rights as more and more women joined factories to create the weapons without help from the men who usually did it, as they were participating in the war. This exhibit is a replica of the drills used on World War II planes and marks a major turning point in the US economy because it finally became a world power.

                                    A short film about the horrors of living in Nazi Germany. During WWII, many citizens of the US were influenced by propagandas. Propagandas were released in many types of forms. The first picture is propaganda in a poster form. Back then movie producers such as Disney and Pixar released multiple films about Hitler and his malicious ways. This form of propaganda definitely influenced a bunch of people which is why most of the men went to war and fought for the United States.

                                    Partly, decolonization was overseen by the United Nations, with UN membership as the prize each newly independent nation cherished as a sign of membership in the community of nations. The United Nations Trusteeship Council was suspended in 1994, after Palau, the last remaining United Nations trust territory, achieved independence. This exhibit details the decolonization process throughout Latin American nations.
